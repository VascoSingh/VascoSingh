### **<u>BRONK</u>**

**Overview:** BRONK leverages fluorescent confocal microscopy and MATLAB for high-throughput cell analysis. Enhancements to existing image processing code allow multi-channel cell segmentation, endosomal escape detection, and integration with cell tracking software. Focusing on the challenge of endosomal escape in intracellular drug delivery, the suite quantifies Galactin-8 puncta, indicative of endosomal disruption, bridging the gap between high-content microscopy data and actionable insights.

- **Technologies Used:** MATLAB, nd2reader, writeFCS, MIB2, BioFormats

### **<u>Vanderbilt Acorns</u>**

**Overview:** A Vanderbilt Acorn is an ERC-721M NFT granting access to a token-gated ecosystem. It integrates with web3 protocols like Syndicate and Snapshot, and web2 platforms such as Google Cloud, GitHub, Discord, and Telegram. Unlike traditional NFTs known for trading value, the Acorn is non-transferrable and serves as an immutable record of one's affiliation with Vanderbilt.

**What We Did:** At Vanderbilt Acorns, we leveraged the power of NFTs to create a unique, token-gated access system. This project integrated both web2 and web3 platforms, establishing a bridge between traditional online services and the innovative world of blockchain.

- **Front-End Technologies:** Built with React on the Next.js framework. Utilized Chakra-UI for styling and wagmi for smart contract interactions.
- **Back-End Technologies:** Primarily developed in Solidity and deployed to the Ethereum mainnet. Additionally, Firebase was used for email verification, specifically for Vanderbilt email validations.
